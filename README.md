### Jquery IE Placeholder Plugin

This plugin emulates the placeholder behavior for IE browsers!
To use, just import the ie-placeholder.js AFTER your jquery 1.7+ script.
This plugin works with the original attr placeholder for input or textareas, you don't need to do any other customization.
Now when you open your page on IE the placeholder thing will look like any HTML5 browser.
You can style your placeholder to look like other browsers by adding styling code to the .ie-placeholder class.
